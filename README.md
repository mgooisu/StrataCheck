# StrataCheck
Body corporate document analysis site that reduces the complexity of documents for customers.

## Rubric
Strata Title owners sign body corporate contracts to pay things like levies,
building insurance, lift maintenance, plant maintenance, sinking fund
erosion, etc. There is considerable information (sometimes 200-900+
double sided print pages) in these contracts and there are important
financial allocations to be aware of. Queensland has some of the most
regulated consumer protections in strata titling. Lawyers provide a time-
based service for contract analysis but itâ€™s an expensive and imperfect
option.
Our document check changes the situation for the buyer. It enables the
purchaser to look at key areas within those 200+ pages of information and
identify whether your building arrangement sits within the parameters of
normal or acceptable terms. The aim of this project is to digitise the
document check.
## Deliverables
The project involves developing a document submission landing page
where strata title engaging customers submit two forms of information for
analysis.
Complex analysis
The customer submits their contract documents for text and table analysis
and information extraction. Bradley reads and labels each document.
Documents are well structured and are more homogenous than
heterogeneous. We need a group of talented data scientists and software
engineers to develop a flexible internal toolbox, and incorporate off-the-
shelf solutions where feasible, to tackle the above challenge.
Basic analysis
Customers submit a series of answers to a web-based questionnaire,
answers are analysed and basic feedback is returned. The feedback
provides context and range considerations for information supplied and
ratings re:
1. are they in danger?
2. is it a high-risk contract?
3. are there multiple things they should be checking out with regards to
their contract?

Over the lifetime of this project (with successive teams) our aspirational
goals are to develop:
1. Cloud Infrastructure that handles data input/output, software
developments, deployments, system maintenance, security, and
scalability, related to the entire development cycle for coding, modeling,
UI, and middle-tier business logic.

2. A library of open-source packages (such as scikit-learn and PyTorch) and
later a custom/open-source developed ML technology for model
development.

3. An auditor with user-friendly UI to monitor model performance and
audit machine learning pipeline
4. Document Analysis through ML application with a UI, designed to
analyse documents, extract data, and display and review document
information.

This is clearly aspirational, and we would just be thankful for a motivated
team to get us started and under way for what is ultimately a large-scale
project.
